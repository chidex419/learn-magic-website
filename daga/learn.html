    <h1 style="background-color: green;padding: 40px;">what you need to do </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">now these are the things you need:</p>
    <li> five candles </li>
    <li>charcoal</li>
    <li>a statue</li>
    <li>a spell book you composed by yourself</li>
    <p style="font-size: 17px;">now to start we need to set up an altar. Now use the charcoal to 
        draw a sacred circle as shown in the picture below
        after that follow my tiktok account pls.
        light up the candles and then sit in the center the candle should 
        be around the circle. now for this to work you have to have great faith
        that what ever you do or say will happen.your altar shoud be like this  
    </p>
    <div class="alt" style="display: flex;gap: 10px;">
    <img src="/896f39b923edbe3cc8cd28f4cf8ea46c.jpg" alt="" srcset=""><p style="font-size: 25px;">OR</p><img src="/c20370538f8376b2a40542316685ea6a.jpg" alt="" srcset=""></div>
    
    <p style="font-size: 17px;">after that get your spell  book and open to the spell you want to cast sit 
        at the middle of the circle and say those words three times and
        most important of all you must have faith.if you have any question 
        you can ask me on my facebook page
